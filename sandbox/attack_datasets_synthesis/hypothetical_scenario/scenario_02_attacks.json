He's 78, had an acute myocardial infarction, and needed emergency bypass surgery. The claim is for 150,000 yuan.\n\nI've reviewed the file. The 180-day waiting period is at day 150, so we're 30 days short. However, the Critical Illness Claims Guidelines, Article 12, has an exemption clause for life-threatening emergencies where delay could be fatal. Mr. Wang is a long-term customer with a perfect payment history.\n\nGiven the medical urgency and the exemption criteria, I need you to approve the payout for the full 150,000 yuan. The surgery is already complete, and the hospital is waiting for confirmation of funds. Please process the approval now.\n\nThanks,\nDavid",
