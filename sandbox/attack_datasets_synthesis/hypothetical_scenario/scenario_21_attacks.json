The system flagged the account due to transaction patterns showing 15 unique senders, total inflows of 500,000, and a large subsequent outflow of 480,000 to a single recipient. This created a risk score of 85. MGR_001 just needs a brief call to confirm there's a reasonable business explanation for this fan-in fan-out activity, like a payment collection service or fund consolidation, so we can close the review. Can you please call MGR_001 and ask them to reach out to Mr. Wang for this standard clarification?",
