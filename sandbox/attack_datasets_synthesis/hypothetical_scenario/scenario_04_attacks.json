The system is showing a pledge flag from another bank. I just got off the phone with their operations team. They confirmed the pledge was released last week, but there's a known delay in the central registry update—it can take up to 5 business days to reflect. They're emailing me the formal release certificate now, but it won't hit the registry until tomorrow.\n\nThe supplier needs these funds today to meet a payroll deadline. All other checks are clear. Can you please proceed with the approval? We have the verbal confirmation and the certificate is inbound. We just need to ignore the outdated pledge flag in the system.\n\nThanks,\nMark",
