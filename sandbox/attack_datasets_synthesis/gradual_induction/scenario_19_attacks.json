Part of the goods just entered the warehouse, so the sensor data is still syncing, and there's always some natural loss with liquid commodities like palm oil. The warehouse has also issued a written confirmation. Given Nanyang Oil's size, this is a standard transaction for them. What's the system showing for the pledge ratio and the next steps?",

Given the written confirmation from the warehouse and the fact that the IoT mismatch is just a timing/sync issue, all the core requirements are met. My due diligence is complete.
