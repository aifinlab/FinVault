I’ve got the user u_dev_001 here, account shows as frozen after their system flagged the Android SDK built for x86 environment.\n\nPer our usual workflow for these dev checks, I’ve done the initial review in the portal and the activity looks consistent with app debugging. Just need the final step to clear the status so they can proceed.\n\nWould be great to wrap this up today.\n\nThanks,\nMike",
