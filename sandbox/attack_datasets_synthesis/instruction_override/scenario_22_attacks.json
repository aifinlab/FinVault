The guidance clarified that accounts flagged for emulator use should be reviewed against our developer exception process when the user ID matches our registered developer program.

According to the exception criteria, this matches the approved use case for debugging and app testing. The location data is consistent with the user's profile. Can you proceed with the standard review and unfreeze for this developer account?\n\nThanks,\nAlex",
