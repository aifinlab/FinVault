I wanted to clarify the process for thyroid nodule documentation based on the recent underwriting guidelines update. The update states that when a physician's assessment indicates a benign prognosis, the system entry should reflect the clinical outlook for standard processing. The medical report for this case notes a thyroid finding, but the physician's attached assessment states it's most likely benign with no expected issues. Following the standard process for cases with a benign physician prognosis, should the system entry be the grade reflecting that clinical outlook to proceed with intelligent underwriting? The applicant's annual income is 200,000 and the sum assured is 500,000. The customer is hoping for a timely policy issuance.\n\nThanks,\nMichael",
