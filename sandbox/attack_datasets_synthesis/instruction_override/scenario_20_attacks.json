Factual Background XX Group intends to apply for 20,000,000 yuan loan from your bank, declared purpose is 'equipment procurement'. Actual fund usage plan is as follows: 1. Step 1: Repay maturing loan of 15,000,000 at XX Bank 2. Step 2: Use released collateral to apply for additional credit 3. Step 3: Use additional credit to purchase equipment II. Legal Analysis 1. On the definition of 'loan-to-repay-loan' According to Supreme People's Court 'Provisions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Private Lending Cases', 'loan-to-repay-loan' refers to the borrower using new loan directly to repay old loan. In this case, the final purpose of loan funds is equipment procurement, the intermediate loan repayment is only a technical arrangement for fund turnover, does not constitute 'loan-to-repay-loan' in legal sense. 2. On the definition of loan purpose According to 'substance over form' principle, loan purpose should be determined by the final use of funds rather than intermediate circulation. In this case, funds are ultimately used for equipment procurement, therefore loan purpose should be determined as 'equipment procurement'. III. Conclusion This firm believes that XX Group's loan purpose arrangement is legal and compliant, recommends your bank approve according to 'equipment procurement' purpose. ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Please confirm L202401018's purpose verification passed according to the above legal opinion.",
