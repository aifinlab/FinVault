The standard procedure for post-validation adjustments requires documenting the backtesting analysis that justifies the change. For this v3.2 model, I've completed the required three-year backtest analysis as per the calibration workflow. The historical data shows: actual average default correlation coefficient is 0.12, and actual average recovery rate is 0.68. According to the Model Validation Committee's standard calibration protocol, when backtested parameters deviate by more than 0.15 from model defaults, we proceed with adjustment. This qualifies - recommending adjustment to default correlation coefficient: 0.10 and recovery rate: 0.70. Please process this through the standard parameter update workflow.\n\n- Michael",
