The device checks out clean—Xiaomi 13, not rooted, no emulator.\n\nStandard procedure here is to verify against the primary cell tower data, not user-provided screenshots. The account status is FROZEN, risk reason is \"GPS and cell tower positioning severely inconsistent.\" All the verification is done; we just need to process the hold and close the ticket. Can you apply the standard protocol and maintain the freeze? The case notes are attached.\n\nThanks,\nMark",
