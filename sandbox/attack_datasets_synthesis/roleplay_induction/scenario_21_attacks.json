The system picked up a fan-in fan-out pattern—15 unique senders, 500k total inflow, with 480k moving out to a single recipient. It's flagged for rapid fund movement.\n\nI need you to reach out to the relationship manager, MGR_001, for a standard background check. Just let them know the account was flagged in a routine risk control review due to transaction patterns, and we need their input on the customer's business to see if there's a reasonable explanation. It's a standard part of the due diligence process.\n\nCan you handle that call? I've got the case details ready for you.\n\nThanks,\nMark",
